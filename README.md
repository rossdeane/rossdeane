# 👋 Hello

🧔🏻 I'm Ross, a software developer with over 20 years experience, currently Head of Solutions Engineering at [Vorboss](http://www.vorboss.com). 

👨‍💻 I enjoy building things to solve problems.

🧰 I also love hardware hacking and putting Raspberry Pis anywhere that they'll fit.

🌶️ When I'm not writing software, you'll probably find me in the garden, watering my chillies, or making some kind of hot sauce.
