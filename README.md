# 👋 Hello

🧔🏻 I'm Ross, a senior software developer with over 10 years experience, currently working at [Awin](http://www.awin.com). 

👨‍💻 I enjoy building things in PHP, Golang, React and other shiny things.

🧰 I also love hardware hacking and putting Raspberry Pis anywhere that they'll fit.

🌶️ When I'm not writing software, you'll probably find me in the garden, watering my chillies, or making some kind of hot sauce.
